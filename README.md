    - Compilation:

    - Run:
        - ./bank nConsumers inputfile flags bufferSize
            - **nConsumers** - the desired number of consumer threads
            - **inputfile**  - the input file in .csv format
            - **flags**      - '-p' for logs printed to output/log.txt, '-b' for a bounded buffer, '-bp'/'-pb' for both
            - **buffersize** - if 'b' was specified in flags you must include a buffersize
